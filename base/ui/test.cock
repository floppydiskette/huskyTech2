// each line or block will begin with two coordinates separated by a comma,
// or the letter 'X' to specify that they should be centred on the screen.
// the letter 'X' can also be followed by a number (with or without a negative sign) to specify an offset.

// image names are relative to the imgz directory in the base directory.
